I am a software developer with experience and knowledge in web development. Among my most outstanding skills are: front-end development, web layout, responsive design, attention to detail and predisposition to face new challenges. The technologies I master the most are JavaScript, Python, MySQL, Html5, Css3, Figma. I am currently acquiring skills in Reactjs and Nodejs. âš¡
